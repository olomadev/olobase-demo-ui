## Installing Node.js Using Nvm Manager

Install nvm

```sh
sudo apt update
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm --version
```

Please install the following components in your working environment.

* Node.js 18.15.0 and above

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh
```

Take a look and make sure you are comfortable with the changes it is making. When you are satisfied, run the command again with | bash appended at the end. The URL you use will change depending on the latest version of nvm, but as of right now, the script can be downloaded and executed by typing:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

This will install the nvm script to your user account. To use it, you must first source your .bashrc file:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, you can ask NVM which versions of Node are available:

```
nvm list-remote
```

```
. . .
       v16.11.1
       v16.12.0
       v16.13.0   (LTS: Gallium)
       v16.13.1   (LTS: Gallium)
       v16.13.2   (LTS: Gallium)
       v16.14.0   (Latest LTS: Gallium)
        v17.0.0
        v17.0.1
        v17.1.0
        v17.2.0
        v17.3.0
        v17.3.1
        v17.4.0
        v17.5.0
        v17.6.0
        v20.9.0  (Latest)
        v20.11.1 (Latest LTS: Iron)
        v21.0.0
```

Itâ€™s a very long list! You can install a version of Node by typing any of the release versions you see. For instance, to get version v16.14.0 (another LTS release), you can type:

```
node -v

// output: v16.14.0
```

```
nvm install 20.11.1
```

if you already have another version use "use" keyword

```
nvm use 20.11.1
```

Set default version

```
nvm alias default node
```

You can see the different versions you have installed by typing:

```
nvm list
```
